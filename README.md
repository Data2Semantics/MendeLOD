# MendeLOD

MendeLOD is a Python-based API wrapper for the Mendeley API that (in the future) will publish Mendeley publications as Linked Data. 

The [first version](https://github.com/Data2Semantics/MendeLOD/releases/tag/v0.1) generates an HTML page with publications ordered by year.

A live version of the tool can be found at <http://krr.cs.vu.nl/publications>.
